# Security Principles

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand the CIA Triad and its importance.
- Explain Risk, Privacy, and Accountability.
- Relate securit
y principles to real-world cyber incidents.

## CIA Triad
- The CIA Triad forms the foundation of information security.
- Each element ensures that information remains safe and trustworthy.

| Element | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Confidentiality | Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users. | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists. |
| Integrity | Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with. | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums. |
| Availability | Ensures systems and data are available when needed. | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection. |

## Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key — too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).

| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Confidentiality* | Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.         | Encrypting files, using passwords, access control lists. |
| *Integrity*       | Ensures data is accurate, consistent, and not tampered with. | Using hashing, digital signatures, checksums.            |
| *Availability*    | Ensures systems and data are available when needed.          | Redundant servers, backups, DDoS protection.             |

# Key Concepts
- Data breaches often occur when one or more CIA principles are compromised.
- Balance is key - too much focus on one (e.g., availability) can weaken another (e.g., confidentiality).
# Examples
- *Confidentiality Violation:* Unauthorized access to customer data (e.g., Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case).
- *Integrity Violation:* Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis.
- *Availability Violation:* DDoS attack on banking websites preventing service access.

# Risk, Privacy, and Accountability
# Risk
- *Definition:* Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to cause harm.

## Components:
- *Threat* -> something that can cause damage.
- *Vulnerability* -> weakness that can be exploited.
- *Impact* -> damage if threat is realized

## Formula:
- *Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact*
## Example:
- *Threat:* Phishing

##examples
- Confidentiality violation:Unaouthorized access to customer data(e.g, Favebook-Cambridge Analytic case).
- Integrity Violation:Tampered medical data in hospitals leading to misdiagnosis
- Availability violation: DDos attack on banking websites preventing service access

# Risk,Privacy and Accountability
## Risk
- Defenition: probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability to cause harm
*components*
  - Threat-->something that can cause damage
  -  Vulnerability--> weakness that can be exploited
  -  Impact--> damage if threat is realized
*Formula*
  - Risk=Threat x Vulnerability x Impact
 
## examples
- Threat: phishing
- Vulnerability: Employee lack of awareness
-  Impact:Credential theft,financial loss

# Privacy
- protecting personal and sensitive information of individuals
- Governed by Laws lik GDPR,DPDP Act (India),HIPAA.

## key practices:
- Data minimization
- Informed consent
- Data anonymization

Example: A healthcare app must not share user health data without consent

# Accountability
Ensuring every action in an IT system can be traced back to an induvidual.

## Achieved through:
- Logging & auditing
- Using access tracking
- Non-repudiation mechanisms


Example:Audit logs in firewalls to trace malicious user actions.
